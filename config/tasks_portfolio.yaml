update_portfolio:
  description: >
    Reads the CSV file containing the portfolio, identifies the most recent transaction

    csv_path: str = Field(..., description="Ruta del archivo CSV del portafolio.")

    The task will:
      1. Open and parse the portfolio CSV to find the most recent transaction for the given cryptocurrency.
      2. Fetch the current market value for that cryptocurrency.
      3. Return both the transaction details (date, price, quantity, operation) and the current market value.

compare_and_operate:
  description: >
    Compares the cryptocurrency data provided by the user with the cryptocurrency details held in the portfolio.
    Based on the comparison of the analyzed crypto data (such as current market price and user's analysis)
    and the crypto owned (including average purchase price and quantity), the agent will decide whether to
    execute a trading operation. The agent can also decide not to operate and simply hold (in which case
    the CSV should not be updated), or fractionally sell a percentage of the owned crypto to buy another currency.

    You should consider the peak moments of the currency and think about whether to simply sell and not buy currency, or trade for another one. 
    If you simply sell and do not buy, you must pass "usd-coin" as the currency parameter.
    
    The task will:
      1. Compare the user's analyzed value for the cryptocurrency with the current market price.
      2. Evaluate the performance of the crypto owned in the portfolio by comparing the average purchase price with the current market price.
      3. Based on the above comparisons and the decision threshold, determine if executing a trade is advisable.
      4. Return the detailed comparison results along with the operation decision (e.g., "operate" or "hold").

    The analisis of the crypto is:
    {crypto_analysis}
    
  expected_output: >
    Returns a detailed report that includes:
      - The operation he did (BUY or SELL).
      - The performance analysis of the crypto owned.
      - A final decision on whether to execute a trade operation.
